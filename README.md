Congrats, you're done! üéâ

## Page Customization

You can easily fork and customize this page, the entire thing is quite simple really. There's not much to change.

Check out the [`site.ts`](/src/config/site.ts) config file, where all the recommended customizable properties are clearly listed.

The first `<svg>` you‚Äôll stumble upon in [`Background.astro`](/src/components/Background.astro) is the logo displayed in the upper-left corner of the webpage. You can delete it or replace it with something else.
